#What is Senet Online?
Senet Online was a web recreation of the egyptian game Senet, this game was made in 2014 and was updated until 2015. I assume the dev quit or something happened to him as his game is off the playstore and etc.

#How do I play?
Until I can decompile the client, you can only play on ChromeOS <v105 and Android (Only tested on android-7).
If you have one of those devices go the release tab and download the .crx or .apk for your version.
